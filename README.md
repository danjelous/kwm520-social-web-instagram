Prototype which calls your Instagram-Feed (if you login ofc :), sends it to the Google Vision API and expresses recogniced emotions and feelings via the text to speech API. Intended to test accessibility issues and gain insights on how to describe feelings and amotions in a picture for people which are not able to see them (due to various injuries).
